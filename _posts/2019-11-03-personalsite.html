<p>I have been working on a personal site for a few months now, taking inspiration from some design templates and working to include the many projects and aspects of my life. I ultimately chose to create my site using Jekyll for the ease of hosting with Github. I also was looking to build a site that I could easily update as I continue to create new things. I have taken much of the design from v1.0 and brought that into this version, adding multi-page layout and full post pages.</p>

<p>Throughout the site I use my own photography and logo designs. I hope to add sections to the site in the future to showcase my photography and other skills.</p>
