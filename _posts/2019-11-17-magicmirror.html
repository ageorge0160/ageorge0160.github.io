<p>It has taken me awhile to write up anything on this project but it is one of my favorites. Last year my boyfriend mentioned that he would like a smart mirror someday but they are very expensive. While searching around for a good price on one, I found the endless tutorials on how to make one. Thus began my first Raspberry Pi project and a well received Christmas gift.</p>

<p>I already had an old computer monitor I had lying around and set to work taking the casing apart.</p>

<p>I installed the open source project MagicMirror (https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) on the Raspberry Pi to display some sports scores, weather and a floating snowflake background (it was winter after all). </p>

<p>Next, I made the two way mirror with some glass from an extra picture frame and privacy film from the hardware store. It took a couple attempts to not have bubbles in the mirror but was a great cost saver. I built a custom wood frame that was able to fit all the cords and pieces and used the mounting brackets of the original monitor case to secure it.</p>

<p>It has worked well so far, but is a bit heavy. For now it stays on top of a dresser until we are no longer in a rental and willing to put some holes in the wall for it. Overall, the project took about a month and made a great Christmas present and easy introduction to Raspberry Pi projects. </p>
