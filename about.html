<p>I spent many years as an outdoor guide and park ranger before learning to code. After completing the Full Stack with React program through the Flatiron School I began working as a Software Engineer in a DevOps role. Outside of my work day I am nature photographer, crafter and maker.</p>

<p>The photographs on this site are from my portfolio. Checkout more here:</p>
